# C - Binary Trees :pencil2:

> A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root); thus, for every node, a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes it possible to distinguish a left child from a right child.But this still does not distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a node with right but no left child.

At the end of this project, We were able to undesrtand these questions:
  
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that creates a binary tree node
1. Function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
2. Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
3. Function that deletes an entire binary tree
4. Function that checks if a node is a leaf
5. Function that checks if a given node is a root
6. Function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
7. Function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
8. Function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
9. Function that measures the height of a binary tree
10. Function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
11. Function that measures the size of a binary tree
12. Function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
13. Function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
14. Function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
15. Function that checks if a binary tree is full
16. Function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
17. Function that finds the sibling of a node
18. Function that finds the uncle of a node
